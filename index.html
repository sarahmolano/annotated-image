        <p> The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) has long faced a plethora of issues, and this past year has been no different. In an effort to remedy its enormous debt and infrastructure issues, NYCHA unveiled its <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/residents/blueprint-for-change.page">“A Blueprint for Change”</a> last year. </p>

        <p> “NYCHA’s A Blueprint for Change is a set of ideas for how we can invest in our properties, residents, and organization,” the agency’s website says. “The Blueprint is designed to improve your home while protecting your rights as a resident.” </p>

        <p> But some residents and advocates aren’t buying it. Around 150 people <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/getting-to-the-yoke-of-the-issue-nycha-tenants-rally-against-a-blueprint-for-change/">rallied against the plan</a> outside of NYCHA offices in Lower Manhattan on March 23. Click through the photo below to learn more about the Blueprint and why people are opposing it. </p>

                    <h3>Repairs Needed</h3>
                    <p>NYCHA currently needs around $40 billion to make necessary repairs in its buildings. The Blueprint is meant to bring capital funds for those repairs, according to NYCHA.</p>

                    <h3>Skepticism</h3>
                    <p>Residents and advocates fear that the Blueprint will lead to privatization of NYCHA’s 110,000 units. In turn, some residents believe they will be priced out of their apartments.</p>

                    <h3>NYCHA Responds</h3>
                    <p>NYCHA says no residents will be displaced and that rent will continue to be capped at 30% of household income.</p>

                    <h3>A Not-So-Clean History</h3>
                    <p>Opponents of the Blueprint cite NYCHA’s controversial history and unsanitary conditions, such as the agency lying on lead cleanup reports that led to at least 19 children contracting lead poisoning.</p>

                    <h3>Conversion</h3>
                    <p>The Blueprint will convert all of NYCHA’s Section 9 public housing developments into Section 8 housing, which utilizes private financing.</p>
